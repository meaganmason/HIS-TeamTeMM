# HIS-TeamTeMM

This website was made by Michael Mellorn, Meagan Mason, and Terrence Young. The business we did our website on was Chad Mellorn’s Home Improvement Specialties. The colors we chose were based on Chad’s company logo’s color. We thought the grey and dark red went together well, and liked the font we chose. Our goal with our design was to make navigation as simple as possible. We wanted to use at least one image on every page and try to add details to make the website appealing.  

We had a lot of struggles with people being absent and had to get help finishing on the last day. This is not the best of our work, but we tried to put it together as best as we could with the lack of time we had. We hope you enjoy our website. 

 

Sincerely,  

Team TeMM
